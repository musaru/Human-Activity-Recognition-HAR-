***A Deep Bidirectional LSTM Model Enhanced by Transfer-Learning-Based Feature Extraction for Dynamic Human Activity Recognition***

# Abstract
Dynamic human activity recognition (HAR) is a domain of study that is currently receiving considerable attention within the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition. The growing need for artificial-intelligence (AI)-driven systems to evaluate human behaviour and bolster security underscores the timeliness of this research. Despite the strides made by numerous researchers in developing dynamic HAR frameworks utilizing diverse pre-trained architectures for feature extraction and classification, persisting challenges include suboptimal performance accuracy and the computational intricacies inherent in existing systems. These challenges arise due to the vast video-based datasets and the inherent similarity in the data. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative, dynamic HAR technique employing a deep-learning-based, deep bidirectional long short-term memory (Deep BiLSTM) model facilitated by a pre-trained transfer-learning-based feature-extraction approach. Our approach begins with the utilization of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, specifically MobileNetV2, for extracting deep-level features from video frames. Subsequently, these features are fed into an optimized deep bidirectional long short-term memory (Deep BiLSTM) network to discern dependencies and process data, enabling optimal predictions. During the testing phase, an iterative fine-tuning procedure is introduced to update the high parameters of the trained model, ensuring adaptability to varying scenarios. The proposed modelâ€™s efficacy was rigorously evaluated using three benchmark datasets, namely UCF11, UCF Sport, and JHMDB, achieving notable accuracies of 99.20%, 93.3%, and 76.30%, respectively. This high-performance accuracy substantiates the superiority of our proposed model, signaling a promising advancement in the domain of activity recognition.
